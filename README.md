# Bixby example_missing_input

For Bixby Developers.  

There are times when your capsule will require input. But if you are unaware of how to  
prompt a user for input then you end up with some generic text asking for "xys" to continue

To combat this you must use an input view which will get called when required information  
is missing. By adding the input view you will be able to see something like the picture below.

To see it in action for youself simply download the example code and try commenting and  
uncommenting the content in the input.view.bxb file.
